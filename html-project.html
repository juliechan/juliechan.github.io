    <strong>About this course:</strong>

  This course gives you easy access to the invaluable learning techniques used by experts in
  art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. We’ll learn about
  the how the brain uses two very different learning modes and how it encapsulates (“chunks”)
  information. We’ll also cover illusions of learning, memory techniques, dealing with
  procrastination, and best practices shown by research to be most effective in helping you
  master tough subjects.
  </p>
  <p>
  Using these approaches, no matter what your skill levels in topics you would like to master,
    you can change your thinking and change your life. If you’re already an expert, this peep
    under the mental hood will give you ideas for: turbocharging successful learning, including
    counter-intuitive test-taking tips and insights that will help you make the best use of
    your time on homework and problem sets. If you’re struggling, you’ll see a structured
    treasure trove of practical techniques that walk you through what you need to do to get
    on track. If you’ve ever wanted to become better at anything, this course will help serve
    as your guide.
  </p>
<p>
  This course can be taken independent of, concurrent with, or prior to, its companion course,
  Mindshift. (Learning How to Learn is more learning focused, and Mindshift is more career
  focused.)

  <ol>
    <li>Week 1
      <p><h3>What is Learning?</h3>
      Although living brains are very complex, this module uses metaphor and analogy
      to help simplify matters. You will discover several fundamentally different modes of
      thinking, and how you can use these modes to improve your learning. You will also be
      introduced to a tool for tackling procrastination, be given some practical information
      about memory, and discover surprisingly useful insights about learning and sleep.
      <br><br><em>(Please note that this module should only take about an hour--the extra time
      quoted relates to purely optional activities.)</em>
      </p></li>
    <li>Week 2
      <p>
        <h3>
          Chunking</h3>
In this module, we’re going to be talking about chunks. Chunks are compact packages of
      information that your mind can easily access. We’ll talk about how you can form chunks,
      how you can use them to improve your understanding and creativity with the material,
      and how chunks can help you to do better on tests. We’ll also explore illusions of
      competence in learning, the challenges of overlearning, and the advantages of interleaving.

      </p>
    </li>
<li> Week 3
<h3>
  Procrastination and Memory</h3>
In this module, we talk about two intimately connected ideas—procrastination and memory.
  Building solid chunks in long term memory--chunks that are easily accessible by your short
  term memory—takes time. This is why learning to handle procrastination is so important.
  Finally, we talk about some of the best ways to access your brain’s most powerful long term
  memory systems.
